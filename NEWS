v15:
 * Remove -Wl,-zdefs from XBPS_LDFLAGS. Too many packages are broken with
   that enabled, and there's not enough time to fix all them.
 * New [optional] var for templates 'shlib_depends'. This overwrites the
   required pattern for a run dependency set by its `depends' file.

v14:
 * Strip shared and static libraries with --strip-unneeded.
 * XBPS_LDFLAGS now contains -Wl,-zdefs by default, to abort if there
   are unresolved symbols at build time.
 * Adjust the code to make it work with xbps>=0.12.

v13:
 * Renamed XBPS_DISTRIBUTIONDIR in xbps-src.conf to XBPS_DISTDIR (shorter).
 * Set XBPS_DISTDIR to $HOME/xbps-packages by default.
 * Set XBPS_MASTERDIR to $XBPS_DISTDIR/masterdir by default.
 * If XBPS_MASTERDIR dir doesn't exist, create it.
 * New option XBPS_SRCPKGS_REPOURL to specify the URL to fetch
   the xbps-packages git repository.
 * New target: fetch-srcpkgs. To clone the xbps-packages git repository
   as defined by XBPS_SRCPKGS_REPOURL.
 * -B option can be used with the "bootstrap" target to install a bootstrap
   from binary packages rather than building it from source.

v12:
 * New (optional) var for templates 'build_requires' which expects a minimal
   version of xbps-src required to build a package and its subpkgs.

v11:
 * Uses the new virtualpkg trigger from xbps-triggers-0.32.
 * New xbps.conf for xbps-0.11 for the chroot.
 * Fixed make-repoidx target in no-chroot case.

v10:
 * Fixed paths for chroot and non chroot case in set_defvars().

v9:
 * xbps-src now copies /etc/services to the chroot (masterdir) to make
   https URLs work with xbps-uhelper.
 * The home directory of the user running xbps-src for chroot operations
   has been changed to /tmp.
 * The changes listed above are *only* applied on newly created chroots.

v8:
 * xbps-src failed to detect required shlibs from the same package, when
   them were symlinks and not real files.

v7:
 * xbps-src now provides required XBPS configuration file for use in
   chroot operations, adding local repositories by default.

v6:
 * Fixed the 'show-deps' target to show dependencies that contain the +
   character on its pkgname.

v5:
 * Implemented 'show-deps' target to print build or run time dependencies
   for a source package.
 * It's possible to use xbps-src code from non-default PATH by setting the
   environment variable DESTDIR.
