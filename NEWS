v18:
 * Disabled automatic revision bump due to unmatched changes in required
   shared libraries (.rshlibs files). The user must find out why
   the shlibs do not match anymore and revbump manually if necessary.
 * Removed empty directories for main pkg and all its subpkgs.

v17:
 * Fixed a bug that made all pkgs contain INSTALL/REMOVE scripts even
   if they aren't necessary.

v16:
 * Try harder when resolving every component in every symlink, emulate
   'readlink -f' which doesn't work if target files aren't available.
 * New [optional] var for templates: 'mutable_files'. This accepts a file
   list to specify some files that could be modified once a binary package
   has been installed; such example could be the kernel package and
   its files "modules.dep and modules.symbols" that could be modified when
   a new external module has been built (from virtualbox for example).
   Please note that this only will have effect with XBPS>=0.12.

v15:
 * Remove -Wl,-zdefs from XBPS_LDFLAGS. Too many packages are broken with
   that enabled, and there's not enough time to fix all them.
 * New [optional] var for templates 'shlib_depends'. This overwrites the
   required pattern for a run dependency set by its `depends' file.
 * Fixed issue 20 in googlecode "xbps-src dependency version check isn't working".
   When building packages with srcpkg deps and installed dependency isn't
   satisfied, do the following:
	- If pkgdep is installed but not satisfied and srcpkg satisfies the
	  dependency, remove pkgdep and reinstall new dependency from srcpkgs.
	- Or if dependency from srcpkgs doesn't satisfy requirement error out.

v14:
 * Strip shared and static libraries with --strip-unneeded.
 * XBPS_LDFLAGS now contains -Wl,-zdefs by default, to abort if there
   are unresolved symbols at build time.
 * Adjust the code to make it work with xbps>=0.12.

v13:
 * Renamed XBPS_DISTRIBUTIONDIR in xbps-src.conf to XBPS_DISTDIR (shorter).
 * Set XBPS_DISTDIR to $HOME/xbps-packages by default.
 * Set XBPS_MASTERDIR to $XBPS_DISTDIR/masterdir by default.
 * If XBPS_MASTERDIR dir doesn't exist, create it.
 * New option XBPS_SRCPKGS_REPOURL to specify the URL to fetch
   the xbps-packages git repository.
 * New target: fetch-srcpkgs. To clone the xbps-packages git repository
   as defined by XBPS_SRCPKGS_REPOURL.
 * -B option can be used with the "bootstrap" target to install a bootstrap
   from binary packages rather than building it from source.

v12:
 * New (optional) var for templates 'build_requires' which expects a minimal
   version of xbps-src required to build a package and its subpkgs.

v11:
 * Uses the new virtualpkg trigger from xbps-triggers-0.32.
 * New xbps.conf for xbps-0.11 for the chroot.
 * Fixed make-repoidx target in no-chroot case.

v10:
 * Fixed paths for chroot and non chroot case in set_defvars().

v9:
 * xbps-src now copies /etc/services to the chroot (masterdir) to make
   https URLs work with xbps-uhelper.
 * The home directory of the user running xbps-src for chroot operations
   has been changed to /tmp.
 * The changes listed above are *only* applied on newly created chroots.

v8:
 * xbps-src failed to detect required shlibs from the same package, when
   them were symlinks and not real files.

v7:
 * xbps-src now provides required XBPS configuration file for use in
   chroot operations, adding local repositories by default.

v6:
 * Fixed the 'show-deps' target to show dependencies that contain the +
   character on its pkgname.

v5:
 * Implemented 'show-deps' target to print build or run time dependencies
   for a source package.
 * It's possible to use xbps-src code from non-default PATH by setting the
   environment variable DESTDIR.
