# Configuration file for XBPS.
# ============================
#
# Root directory.
#RootDir = /
#
# Cache directory to store downloaded binary packages.
# If string begins with '/' it will be treated as full path,
# otherwise it will be treated as relative to the root-directory.
CacheDir = host/repocache
#
# Default global limit of cached connections when fetching files.
#FetchCacheConnections = 10
#
# Default per-host limit of cached connections when fetching files.
#FetchCacheConnectionsPerHost = 3
#
# Default timeout limit for connections, in seconds.
#FetchTimeoutConnection = 30
#
# Enable syslog messages, set the value to false or 0 to disable.
Syslog = false

# Repositories.
#
# You can specify here your list of repositories, the first
# repository matching a package expression will be used for most
# targets in xbps-install(8) and xbps-query(8).
#
# Optionally a non default HTTP port can also be specified such as:
# 	http://foo.local:8080/xbps-repo
#
# By default we use the official "public" repositories. You can add
# your own repositories by specifying the path to the directory
# where the plist index file is stored.
#
# Repositories not matching the host architecture are simply ignored.
#
repositories = {
	# Local (xbps >= 0.16)
	/host/binpkgs,
	/host/binpkgs/nonfree,
	# Remotes (xbps >= 0.16)
	http://xbps.nopcode.org/repos/current,
	#http://xbps.nopcode.org/repos/current/nonfree
}

# Packages on hold.
#
# Packages that are put on hold won't be updated even if there is a
# newer version in repository pool. Package names and shell wildcards
# can be specified.
#
#PackagesOnHold = { "glibc-*" }

# Virtual packages.
#
# The following syntax is used:
# 	virtual-package <realpkgname> { targets = <virtualpkgname-version> }
#
# If a package supports multiple virtual packages these can be
# specified in the 'targets' option such as:
#
# 	virtual-package foo { targets = blah-0, baz-1, ... }
#
