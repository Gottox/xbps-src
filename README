INTRODUCTION
============
xbps-src - the XBPS binary package build system.

xbps-src uses ideas from other current package build systems and or
utilities such as in NetBSD/pkgsrc, Debian dpkg/deb, GNU stow, etc.
Its target OS is Linux, meant to be used in Void Linux but could be
adapted to other systems with relatively few changes (don't blame me if it
doesn't work in a random OS).

One of its advantages over other build systems is that you can build the
XBPS binary packages from any other Linux distribution matching the
target architecture, i.e Fedora x86_64 for Void GNU/Linux x86_64.

xbps-src uses "linux-user-chroot" to bind mount required mounpoints in a
specific directory and be able to chroot as normal user. This allows us to
use some Linux features for containers: PID/IPC namespaces and
private mounts (bind mounts are only seen by the same process).

INSTALLATION
============

Simply use the `make && make install clean` sequence to build and install it
into /usr/local by default. Some variables can be overriden thru make(1)
variables:

	- DESTDIR: empty
	- PREFIX: /usr/local by default
	- SBINDIR: PREFIX/sbin by default
	- SHAREDIR: PREFIX/share by default
	- LIBEXECDIR: PREFIX/libexec by default
	- ETCDIR: PREFIX/etc/xbps by default

See the USAGE file to know more in how to use xbps-src.
